Of all the things that you would change,
Above, don't weep for me
And you, you lay awake at night and scheme
But you always knew that you'll be the one
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Cuz this will be the labor of my love
Above the best, improve yourself
But it was just a dream
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town.
Your spirit never dies
ï»¿As a child, you would wait
From dust.
From dust.
From dust
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
That work while they all play
And watch from far away.
