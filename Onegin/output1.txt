Above the best, improve yourself
Above, don't weep for me
And watch from far away.
And you, you lay awake at night and scheme
ï»¿As a child, you would wait
But it was just a dream
But you always knew that you'll be the one
Cuz this will be the labor of my love
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne
From dust
From dust.
From dust.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
Of all the things that you would change,
That work while they all play
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town
We are the warriors that built this town.
Your spirit never dies
